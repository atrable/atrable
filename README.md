## Motivation
How do you get closer to your friends? You share your stories with each other, then you'll understand each other and get closer.

None of the social media that I know was focused on letting us share our actual experiences; they were all focused on some other stuff (ads, entertainment, AR lenses, being real, …). I thought I could make a social networking site that actually focuses on helping us getting closer to others, so I made one.

On Atrable, you are required to record audio to upload a diary. With audio, people would more focus on the stories itself.

## Inspiration

Atrable is inspired by [Pani Bottle (빠니보틀)](https://www.youtube.com/c/%EB%B9%A0%EB%8B%88%EB%B3%B4%ED%8B%80PaniBottle), who travels through the world and shares his experiences on YouTube. He is quite different from other traveler YouTubers; while others focuses on the "cool" things they do (like drinking romantic wine in Paris, eating sushi at a nice place, ...), he shares his honest experiences. It was so interesting for me to watch him struggling with language in a foreign place, finding a decent place to stay, bargaining with the local merchants, and bunch of other stuff that were recorded in his videos.

Inspired by him, I came up with the idea of "audio based social media", where people record their honest stories with audio and share it.
