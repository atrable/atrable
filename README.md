## Motivation
How do we get closer to friends? In my experiences, I shared my stories with my friends. By listening to their stories and understanding each other, I could get much closer to my friends than before.

I thought this was what social media would help us to do: to get closer to our friends with an easy way to share our stories. Well, hope that was the reality lol.

The main goal of the social media platforms out there is to make you spend more time on their platform. To achieve this ambitious goal, they display the most entertaining contents in the feed. That's why it's so fun to use social media, and that's how you get addicted to entertainments and gradually forget about your friends in reality.

Then, how is Atrable different from other social media platforms? On Atrable, you are exposed to you and your friends' audio and video diaries, rather than random entertaining contents from strangers. By watching and chatting with your friends about your stories, you'll be able to get closer to your friends in your real life ðŸ˜º.

## Inspiration

Atrable is inspired by [Pani Bottle (ë¹ ë‹ˆë³´í‹€)](https://www.youtube.com/c/%EB%B9%A0%EB%8B%88%EB%B3%B4%ED%8B%80PaniBottle), who travels through the world and shares his experiences on YouTube. He is quite different from other YouTubers; while others focuses on the "cool" things they do (like drinking romantic wine in Paris, eating sushi at a nice place, ...), he shares his honest experiences that he faces throughout his journey. It was so interesting for me to watch him struggling with language in a foreign place, finding a decent place to stay, bargaining with the local merchants, and bunch of other stuff that were recorded in his videos.

Inspired by him, I came up with the idea of "audio based social media", where people record their honest stories with audio and share it.
